## Installation
  Installing dependencies and environment can be done through the Android Development Studio and its provided SDK Manager, but this guide will assume you are startinhg on a fresh Windows Machine. Instructions are brief and more or less universal so you should be able to install on unix-based systems, if you know what you are doing (and you should if you're running one).
  
### Environment and Team Server Setup
1. Download and install VS Code 2017 (VC2017)
2. Download and install NodeJS
3. Download and install Git
4. In vs code terminal: "npm install -g nativescript"
5. Create a folder somewhere that doesn't require admin privileges (Users\<Username>\Documents for example).
6. Open a CMD there or use the VC2017 Terminal to cd to that folder\
7. git clone
### Debugging:
1. npm install
2. tns init
3. tns debug android
