	"scientificName": "Psilocarphus brevissimus var. brevissimus",
	"overview": "As an annual plant, it completes its life cycle in one year. It sprouts, flowers, produces seeds, and dies all during the warmer months of the year. It has a large habitat across the western North America because of the migrating water fowl that pick up the seeds and take them all over. It has the ability to tolerate high moisture level in the winter and low moisture level in the summer, making well suited for vernal pools. Blooms from May to June. Not endangered.",
	"behavior": "",
	"habitat": "Short Woollyheads have a range all the way from southwestern Canada to California and Northwestern Mexico. It prefers moist flat areas such as wetlands and vernal pools. It can an elevation range of 0 ft to 8000 ft. It can be found in temporarily flooded depressions along ponds though much of its habitat has been lost to agricultural development. Also invasive plant species threaten the native annual by out competing it.  ",
