	"scientificName": "Xanthium spinosum",
	"overview": "As a summer annual herb, it completes its entire life cycle in 1 year, from growing as a seedling to pollinating and dying. It uses spiny burs to disperse to new areas, as these burs easily catch onto animals and that way it can grow in new areas. Their seeds can survive up to 3 years under field conditions. Another trait that helps the plant survive is that it is toxic to animals, especially the seedlings. For people this plant can cause dermatitis for sensitive individuals. Blooms from July to October and is not endangered.",
