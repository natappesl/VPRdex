	"overview": "California ground squirrels utilize cheek pouches while they are foraging to collect more food than would otherwise be possible in one sitting. They use a variety of sounds, tail signals and scent production as means of communication. California ground squirrels reside on the ground and in burrow systems. The burrows can house many generations forming a small colony, and each individual has an entrance of their own.",

	"habitat": "California Ground Squirrels are found from central Washington through western Oregon, California and into the northern part of Baja California. The squirrel is found in plains, small meadows, tree-covered hillsides, rocky outcrops and granite taluses. The northern extent of its range was once bounded by the Columbia River, but the California Ground Squirrel has crossed the river into south-central Washington.",
