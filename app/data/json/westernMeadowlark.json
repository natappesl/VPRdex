	"overview": "Western Meadowlarks are mostly found foraging on the ground alone or, in winter, in small, loose flocks. In spring and summer, males like to sing from any high points, such as trees or power lines. Least concern.",
	"behavior": "",
	"habitat": "Western Meadowlarks like to breed over the spring and summer and forage over the winter. So look for them among low to medium-height grasses more so than in tall fields. They also occur along the weedy verges of roads, marsh edges, and mountain meadows up to 10,000 feet.",
