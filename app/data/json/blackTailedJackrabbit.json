	"overview": "As herbivores, they mostly eat a wide variety of green plants and receives most of their water from plants. To avoid the heat of the day, they rest during the day and feed in the late afternoon and evening. In the winter, it eats more dried and woody plants. They can run up to 30 miles an hour and jump a distance of 20 feet. While avoiding predators, it moves in a zigzag pattern and flashes its white underside of its tail when threatened. They mate year-round and create a fur-filled depression as a nest. Not endangered.",
