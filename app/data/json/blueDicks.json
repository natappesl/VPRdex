	"description": "Blooms between March-May.Its two or three grass like leaves sprout in the springtime from a fibrous bulb (a corm). A flower stalk soon grows upward, reaching sometimes two feet tall. At the top of the stalk there is a tight cluster of violet-blue flowers, varying sometimes from deep violet to white.The corms of blue dicks are eaten by many animals, including mule deer and pocket gophers. These corms were also an important food starch for Native Americans, who managed fields of blue dicks, along with other bulbs and corms.  Natives are said to have used the bulbs raw, fried, broiled, or roasted.",
