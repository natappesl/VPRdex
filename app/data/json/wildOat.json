	"overview": "The wild oat is an annual tufted grass that has erect hollow stems with heights varying from 10 to 50 inches tall. The blades are dark green and grow to 16 inches long and can be irregularly toothed, and the sheathes are slightly hairy.  The height of wild oats is related to the climate of the area, and the stem that produces the seeds, the tiller, depends on the soil. Blooms from April to May and is not endangered. ",

	"habitat": "An invasive species, it originated in Central Asia and now grows across Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America. The wild oat is cultivated and distributed mainly in drier climates, such as deserts, semi desert grasslands, and woodland communities. It prefers an elevation of 2,500 to 7,200 feet. It can grow on nearly all types of soils, yet richer soils increase the longevity. ",
