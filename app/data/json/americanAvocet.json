	"name": "American Avocet",
	"scientificName": "Recurvirostra americana",
	"overview": "Has a long-upturned bill, long legs, and an average wingspan of 23.3 in. It has black-and-white upper parts with either a rusty red or grey head and neck. Their legs are either white grey or dark grey. Usually has a white streak going through the black wings.",
	"behavior": "When foraging for small invertebrates, the American Avocet swings its upturned bill across shallow water to catch its prey. Finds food visually, seeing cues from the surface of the water. Sometimes flocks of them will in unison wade across the shallows swinging their heads from side to side filtering food through their beaks. When dealing with predators, it makes a series of calls that gradually change pitch to stimulate the Doppler effect.",
	"habitat": "Lives in marshes, it uses the shallow waters for food and builds nests in the ground. They prefer shallow lakes and mudflats either along the coast or inland. At the Vernal Pools, they are common throughout the year.",
	"size": "The American avocet measures 40–51 cm (16–20 in) in length, has a wingspan of 68–76 cm (27–30 in) and weighs 275–420 g (9.7–14.8 oz).",
