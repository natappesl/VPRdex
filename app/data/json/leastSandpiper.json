	"overview": "Least Sandpipers eat invertebrates in the mud and sand along the waterâ€™s edge. They feed by probing damp mud with their bills, and use the surface tension of the water to have the prey go quickly from their bill tips to their mouths. Their flocks tend to be smaller than the average sandpiper flock and prefer the drier and higher edges compared to other small sandpipers. They are migratory birds, flying from their winter grounds as far south as Chile all the way North to Alaska for breeding. Least Sandpipers migrate across North America and begin winter by traveling from the southern United States into northern South America. They are in the least concerned section on the endangered species list.",
	"behavior": "",
	"habitat": "Their home is marshland, as they feed on mudflats and other edges of water bodies. They prefer muddier shores that are drier and higher than other small sandpipers, yet can also be found on ocean beaches too. They prefer breeding in wet tundra and boreal forest in North America. ",
